DATA 512 - Assignment 1 - Data Curation

The goal of this project is to construct, analyze, and publish a dataset of monthly traffic on English Wikipedia from January 1 2008 through August 30 2020.

Data Source

The data about Wikipedia page traffic from two different https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_REST_APIendpoints have been combined into a single dataset.

The Legacy Pagecounts API (https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/AQS/Legacy_Pagecounts, https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/#/Pagecounts_data_(legacy)/get_metrics_legacy_pagecounts_aggregate_project_access_site_granularity_start_end) provides access to desktop and mobile traffic data from December 2007 through July 2016.
The Pageviews API (documentation (Links to an external site.), endpoint (Links to an external site.)) provides access to desktop, mobile web, and mobile app traffic data from July 2015 through last month.
