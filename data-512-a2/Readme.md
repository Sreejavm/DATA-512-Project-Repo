Bias in Data - Analysis of Wikipedia Articles

Goal:

The goal of this assignment is to identify potential sources of bias in a corpus of human-annotated data and describe some implications of those biases.
The corpus you will use is called the Wikipedia Talk corpus, and it consists of three datasets. Each dataset contains thousands of online discussion posts made by Wikipedia editors who were discussing how to write and edit Wikipedia articles. Crowdworkers labelled these posts for three kinds of hostile speech: “toxicity”, “aggression”, and “personal attacks”. Many posts in each dataset were labelled by multiple crowdworkers for each type of hostile speech, to improve accuracy.
